 Yo, I am impressed. I am very very impressed with this car right here. This is the Tesla Model 3 the 2024 refresh a lot of people are calling it in Highland. That's not actually in the name, but this car I've only been testing it for maybe a week now, but I've noticed a lot of little things different the main way You're gonna be able to tell this car different from the already very popular model 3 that's out is a new distinctive Angular headlights the new point to your face, but there's a lot more that's new to this car that sort of add up to me to feel like a Honestly a worthy flagship. I know the Model S is you know higher-end and it has a plaid variant and all the performance and all that fun stuff But this is the this is the car that people are going to know and see the most often as a Tesla It's Model 3 in the Model Y so you can argue this is their most important car and it kind of feels now like a mini Model S So let's look at everything that's new so first of all like I said aesthetics are actually one of the big things So when you see these new sleek slim headlights That's how you know you're looking at the new Model 3 But also this is actually a new paint ultra red and I kind of feel like the Canon R5 is getting the color I can actually appreciate it. There's also a new stealth gray color, but I like the ultra red and Just right off the bat. It's a little bit of a further down slope on the nose and It's always been a really simple car, but you can actually tell now it's a little bit more aerodynamic Which is going to give you a little bit better range? I've been driving this car for a couple days getting averaging well under 300 watt hours per mile and out of full-stated charge 330 miles of range in the cold this weather now It's it's a Tesla standard 30 miles of range So you're probably going to get more like 290 285 something like that But still the fact that it's getting the same range as what my plaid was getting is pretty impressive So officially the new drag coefficient is 0.219 and that's mostly going to come from the front of the car And the places that are hitting the most air from the side It's still going to look just like a normal Model 3 maybe you can tell that little Front shape is slightly different with a slightly lower nose, but slightly updated wheels too I'm really liking this Ultra red color But yeah, it looks like a Model 3 from the side until you get to the back Which is where you'll see the new tail lights and they are also pretty distinctive An angular and I think pretty nice Here's a maybe hot take The no Tesla logo It just says Tesla in text now on the back And at first I didn't really love that but I've started to get used to it So the only Tesla logo is actually on the front hood And if I want to open it up That power liftgate is the same as it's always been And you've got a pretty decent sized trunk but now you'll notice that those those tail lights are one piece So if I close this again you'll see That entire tail light is uninterrupted on the back trunk piece So it doesn't have any gaps at night you just see one continuous light And I like that And they see dual motor This is not a performance trim This is just a standard Model 3 for right now And that's the back But most of the things that are new with this car again are very subtle things And a lot of them are on the inside in quality in materials And in making it feel and drive Like a much more comfortable It's just better just quality all around is higher So I'm going to start with the door Because that's actually the first thing you'll notice So the handle is the same and the way you get in is the same But if you've seen German cars you might have seen this little notch before And this little part here that plugs into the door In general there's a better seal To the entire door all the way around the cabin And that makes this a much quieter car When driving and even when getting inside I'll close it or behind me You probably can't tell But it's pretty quiet And so in general this really still feels very recognizably just like previous Model 3's But everywhere you look there's lots of little things In the direction of premium In the direction of comfortable And in the direction of luxury a little bit Not so much sporty And we'll talk about what I think might work for a performance Model 3 version of this Maybe a little later But let's look around So first of all this is the new steering wheel This I think is the only thing that anyone may have complaints about Because as you can probably notice right away There's no more stocks So the Model 3 always had the stocks while the Model S and X didn't Now there's no more blinker stocks and there's no driver stocks So if you want to switch to drive You put your foot on the brake And swipe forward Or backward just like the Model S Or fun fact actually there's your perndle up here If you really I don't think most people are going to use that But in case of the screen not being on That's how you change gears But then the rest of the steering wheel is your buttons on the steering wheel So here on the right hand side that's going to be your windshield wipers Which you can also switch to automatic Your voice dictation And then this will turn on autopilot And if you want to turn up or down That's going to be the distance between you and the car in front of you Wall and autopilot Then on the left that's your blinkers Left or right blinkers are on the steering wheel in Model 3 now And your high beams And of course your your media and volume But that does mean the middle is a regular horn Not a button on the steering wheel And it is a pretty close to circular wheel So there are some things that people are going to like And there are some things that people are definitely going to have to get used to Like the no stocks But again this is this is in the theme it feels like to me of many model less So then everywhere else you look Improve materials and build quality I like this Alcantara It's nice and soft You've got all the same switches you normally do And the door to get in and out Up here is just your air vents But it's kind of like this fabric here It's a pretty unique look Obviously you're going to have a lot of cars have your screen back here So this is just a very obvious plain open space But I kind of like this sort of a gray fabric And then all the way around the car Which you'll notice especially when you're driving Is this LED lighting So this light strip goes all the way around Up at the front all the way around the side of the car And yes you can change the look of it Just by dragging around and changing the color of the LEDs There's purple There's red Yellow Looks pretty good at night Just because it's again pretty continuous all around the car And then of course here is the main center console This screen has a faster computer And it is way more responsive Like all of the software and everything that you're doing this car Is just as fast as ever And often even faster than I remember Which is awesome And that's always good to see because Tesla has literally been The best software in any car that's not car player androdo For years now Also you may have noticed I've got this uh This new view of the parking spot I'm in Which if I pull for it a little bit you'll notice Zoom's out That is the new high fidelity park assist It's not a 360 camera But it's pretty close It gives you sort of this heat map of The things that are around you You can see the parking lines in the parking lot you're in And then you'll see this little Heat Thing Based on how close you are to the thing behind you So I'm right against the curb now So that's why it's red It's decent I mean that's all improved with Tesla Model 3 These are also now softer, better seats in the front They are heated and ventilated And the back seats are also heated But I'm gonna show you something else And the back seat now that you might like even more So this is the back seat of the Model 3 It's about the same amount of space as before So if I'm getting behind A 6-3 driver's position That's it's not a ton of space But the floor is flat through the middle But look at that A nice flush touch screen With actually some pretty thin bezels Right on the back to control all of the airflow And the HVAC stuff And even a little bit of media if you want to On the back of this car This is a way better back seat experience Honestly this makes such a huge difference As a back seat passenger in this car I've been in the back of a lot of Model 3 Is that it's been ubers and things like that You still have also this LED lighting back here Again I like that these back seats are heated If you want them to be And then the glass over your head With plenty of headroom It's not quite the uninterrupted glass From the Model SNX But it's what we're used to from Model 3 and Y Which is still a whole lot of glass Let me get back up to the driver's seat Because there are a couple things too That are upgraded significantly Just when driving this car Model 3 has always been An easy car to drive I think it's very simple I know there's no stocks now But in general As far as electric cars This might be the easiest one to calibrate to One pedal driving wise Charging network wise just in general But two things One is acoustically It is so much quieter in here when you're driving Which is awesome And then it's a softer suspension noticeably softer This comes at the expense of maybe a bit of a sporty feeling I honestly think the old Model 3 and Y's coil suspension was a little harsh A little firm sometimes And I think a lot of owners would agree with that And this is made really big strides To be way more comfortable to drive And it also has a notably tighter steering radius That wasn't really advertised at all But that's really cool to see And then there's also a much improved speaker system So the speaker is in this car Just driving around In this quiet cabin Listening to the better speakers Is way way better than previously This really feels like a mini model S But still if you're a Model 3 fan You're gonna have some of the hits That you've always been used to The wireless chargers up here The key fob card And then this is the center console storage Which is a big center console spot And this one doesn't move like Model S But there's two cup holders That you can always close just like that And like that So you still got the front trunk spacer used to Still got the rear trunk spacer used to And honestly even the camera quality These cameras when you look at the camera feed from the car Looks much better I can actually see rain drops Much more higher fidelity when I'm driving this car And the blinkers come on This is good man This is a good car So I think the general question you might be wondering Is should you get this car And the only thing I would say Is if you're considering something like a performance version of this Consider what you want to do most of the time when driving I think when street driving This thing is great Most of the time with street driving This thing is great And it's quick It's really quick I'll try to find an official 0-60 time Or some horsepower numbers if I can But for a car with this much range And with a great charging network Like this is a very quick EV A performance version for me would really only gain Maybe two things Obviously the ability to have track mode And be able to dial you know Your traction control To be front wheel driver Real world driver Change the slip Or have a little bit more fun while driving And then maybe getting back to A firmer suspension For that sort of Track oriented driving But for the non-performance version Which this is It's complete It's great It's a flagship It's a mini model S It's refined It's well built I'm very impressed By the new model 3 Let me know what you think Is this a car that you've been looking forward to I've been looking forward to seeing it In the US for so long It was like Europe first And then slowly making its way here Now it's here And I'm happy I got to test it Because this thing's good man This is the car I would recommend So easily to anyone just looking for a first EV That's where I'll leave it Let me know what you think Thanks for watching Catch you in the next one Peace
