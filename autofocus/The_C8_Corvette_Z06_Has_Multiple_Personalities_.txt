 So not that long ago I would got to give you guys a little bit of a preview of the first ever electrified Corvette This is pretty cool. I had some tech in it and as I was leaving they also mentioned Hey, by the way you should get some seat time in 06 the all gas one. It's sick And I was like yeah sure that sounds really fun But also in the back of my head I was like But is there any tech though? Is there any tech in that Corvette? But I said yes anyway, so there it is behind me So I have actually gotten to try this thing first of all The C8 generation of Corvette is kind of everywhere. I've been seeing them all over the road So the opportunity to try something that's kind of been a revelation for Corvette in the same way that electric cars have been For like Kia and Hyundai like this thing is the most popular Corvette ever I've ever seen and it's the 06 so it's a performance upgrades Arrow package a whole bunch of Impressive stats and numbers, but still I wanted to see if there's any tech in it And I'll have an answer see cars like this are obviously super cool and they're fun By the way, I'm shooting this on a new different smartphones if you can tell which one I'm shooting with but Cars like this are fun, right? They are the cliche like track car for the road this 06 package has all of the craziest parts of that So if you start at the front first of all there's a ton of arrow This little front splitter here for downforce is painted carbon fiber those radiators are huge as a new center radiator here Got the LED headlights huge carbon ceramic brakes you get further and further back and we'll get inside in a second But you can tell a 06 on the street anytime you see this little wishbone which by the way is more air intake for cooling it back the brakes rear brakes huge 345 millimeter width tires back here Tainted carbon fiber arrow on the back and even more what the quad exhaust a car like this is It's built to have a lot of fun and ideally owners are having the most fun with it on the track But it turns out basically it takes a lot of tech also for a car like this to have Multiple personalities. I talked about this in the main channel in the remaps Rivera video that car Here's electric and basically has multiple personalities And this one kind of does in the same way you probably heard the other cliche of everyday supercar which is Basically a stack that a car is built for the track Is the opposite of what you want in a normal everyday car that you would take to the grocery store hard loud aggressive firm Then go to the grocery store you want it to be soft relaxed reliable and so having both personalities in one car Well that does take some tech effort, but let's start with the key because if you get a car like this You're gonna end up with a key like this looks pretty reasonable You've got lock and unlock here which will do exactly what you expect But there's also a front trunk and a rear trunk This is one of the first places that you'll notice that this feels a little more like an everyday supercar So let's look at the front trunk first double tap there actually I think I have to unlock the car and then double tap this has always been a problem I haven't been able to get the key to do the front trunk so I'm gonna have to open this real quick hit the button That always works. Okay, so the front trunk is Backpack sized I can fit I'd say two backpacks in the trunk Reasonably you get the idea It's not the biggest thing ever, but the rear trunk is Real so let me show you that so I'm gonna hit this button right here and the entire back of this car is about to lift up To show you not just the engine, but also the rear storage So there's your engine and right here is a little bit of back storage that is actually bigger Couldn't quite fit my golf clubs in it. I tried Maybe if you have a small like thin golf bag you can but there's a net here You can do groceries here and also if you take the hard top off that roof Can slot perfectly down there and fit and close the top so you can drive it as a convertible as well So that's probably step one to being a Dailyable super car. I don't even need a lot of tech to do that You just need the space and then of course remote start so let's see if the microphones on this phone can Take up what's gonna come out here. This is a this is their remote start I Was literally not even exaggerating. I was talking at an overall aim That's something you I've realized you can't really appreciate through YouTube videos is you can hear what the car sounds like But you can't appreciate how loud it is through a video. It's just really hard to capture You're feeling your chest But let me sit in this talk for you and show you some of the reasonable taking might expect so the door handle is under there And it's of course pretty low, but the driver seat of a Corvette looks pretty similar to the way it has Over the past few years very much a cockpit centered around the driving position This steering wheel has got carbon fiber on it and Alcantara two screens here all the AC buttons So you're heated and cooled seats over here for this nice comfortable car. You've got cup holders and you can close those up Drive modes drive selector and neutral manual and even a front nose lift if you look down here You've got traction control nose lift cameras. It's got a full 360 camera. It's got your HD up here this display has wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and Both sound system that I was actually very impressed with there's a bunch of both speakers all around the cabin You can see them up here seem in the door and they sound pretty decent Which of course it's a smaller cabin so you don't need as many speakers to fill the entire cabin, but you do get Quite a bit so I was impressed with that. This is also a little bit of a wireless charger for your phone So if you do put your phone in here you can still have wireless car player Android Auto up there But that's just the sort of creature comforts part of tech But the rest of the tech in this car really comes from harnessing that Drive train right behind you which you can see is the engine behind me. So the engine the numbers are awesome And it track carts exactly what you want. It's a 670 horsepower naturally aspirated V8. It's the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 ever made in a production car It's got a seven speed gearbox automatic transmission flat paint crank. You've heard the thing. It sounds amazing You'll hear that a little bit more later in this video But how do you make that engine and this transmission and this low-firm car? both great on the track and also Comfortable and soft and reasonable in real life couple things. I'm gonna try to talk over the engine We'll see how well that works with the microphone here. Let me know in the comments how well it works But I'm gonna turn the car on again with this push to start So a little bit less loud the second time that cold start was a little more dramatic But as we turn on here you get the display is lighting up and then Corvette software over here on the second screen Which faces me now? I have my iPhone played so first thing it usually does is turn on Apple CarPlay as soon as the Bluetooth lights up But when you're home here You've got a decently Responsive UI to go through all the software features of this car which go from like Homelink programming missing here to navigation to all the cameras in the car of 360 view making sure you don't scrape anything All that is built in here But let's say I want to drive There's modes I think it's the driving modes for this car and there's three main ones that are pre-programmed They're called touring mode sport mode and track mode And I see this in all kinds of cars that are like this, but especially in a car like this which claims to be and really is Daily drivable there's a big difference between those modes So this is the mode selector here. There's actually a knob underneath this thing and I'm gonna start in touring mode so Tour mode here you see steering suspension engine shift brake feel engine sound and PTM all those things are pretty down low as far as as they go so steering soft light weight suspension Step kind of soft. I won't say it's full It's not like it's some some soft air suspension like you might have in the Tesla Model S or something like that But it's about as soft as you could expect to feel in a car that's this low with low profile tires and all these incredibly Racing oriented geometries now if I switch oh and the engine sound part as well is There's actually a variable valves in the back. So about as close as they'll be This is about as quiet as this car can be and as you drive around here in lower RPM ranges most of the time idling under a thousand RPM now and if I were to just drive around a parking lot or go get groceries in touring mode It would never really be super loud and you could get away with not annoying anybody Maybe not in this color, but you get away with it now listen to the difference as the valves open as I switch to Sport mode Little bit of a difference, but now you've got more firm steering suspension engine and shifting brake feel and engine sound Now I'm gonna get to driving this car in a second You can imagine track mode things go all the way up you ride around in slowly higher RPM ranges Round two to three thousand RPM here and in track mode things go all the way firm the steering gets all the way heavy It is the firmest version of the suspension which works great on a track and You get the loudest most of noxious shifts you're staying in high RPM rev ranges the entire time You don't really drive in track mode Well, you can drive in track mode on the street, but you're gonna you're gonna be dealing with the droning sound of the engine most of the time So enough to be talking. Let's just get to what that driving feels like So this is what it's like to drive in its absolute softest most dailyable reasonable settings on regular roads And there's a couple things that I notice and then a couple things that they're also changing that you may or may not notice So number one for me is steering feel that's one of the things you can slide up and down This is the lightest easiest steering that this car has and it's just like a normal car totally reasonable And I definitely feel that when that changes and there's also engine sound Which is the valves that are letting the exhaust either be wide open or as close as possible are actually variable And this is them and they're still getting setting they call it stealth in the menu and it's obviously a little louder than a normal car But when you hear this car with the valves open you realize how much of a drastic difference that makes huge difference So those who are really obvious to me and the suspension is one of the other big ones the suspension I personally don't tend to notice as much maybe it's because I've driven a much bigger variety of cars So like I've driven cars that have really really soft air suspension and then really really firm racing suspensions Just have the the pull start BST here, which we'll see a video on later The difference between this car is soft to suspension and it's firmest you notice it But it's not like the softest version of this car is like ever say it's or something it's still a low firm sports car But that does also change so I go into my mode and I turn everything down to the softest possible low-srpm Easy to drive way and I can easily drive around town like this for a while You'll notice even the shifts like you're typically driving around at 15 miles an hour in third gear Just so you don't get the RPMs too high the valves are shut. You don't make too much noise. You can sneak out of the neighborhood And that's great But you'll hear the difference immediately when I switch to sport mode Here the valves get a little bit louder engine sounds a little bit louder now our pms are gonna start to go up a little bit And immediately you'll stop to hear a little bit more from the car so steering gets a little bit firmer And you go to track mode and it gets even more firm And suspension does also firm up on the responsiveness And how willing the engine is to bump down a gear to give you instant acceleration way more likely to bump down a gear But that's just the middle between Toring and track so let's just go to track short. Why not? Drugs control still on But now we're in track mode And Everything is at its maximum all the menus have gone all the way up Steering is its heaviest and most direct you're also gonna ride above 3000 rpm all the time which is obviously louder and now you have this if you're just driving in 25 miles an hour You have this like troning sound you're not gonna drive a track on a regular road like this all the time You can hear it through the difference This suspension is as firm as it's gonna get the gearbox is as fast and as aggressive as it's gonna get And you're as loud and obnoxious as you can possibly imagine on a public road this car's specialty is how loud it is So an electric car has this like torque shelf like basically a flat almost flat torque curve from any rpm So no matter where you are if you stab it you just get jolted forward with some torque right this naturally aspirated engine Doesn't have a turbocharger so it has a very steady build-up of torque through every single gear Every time you go shift gears you know exactly where to expect the torque It's always building the entire time and there's no like magic point where the boost kicks in and you just have way more torque you're always building torque And torque is fun. It's like you want to talk about it as much as we talk about horsepower because the horsepower numbers are fun Compare and straight lines and stuff like that, but the way it builds it is It's really neat and you know what I'm glad that this is one of those cars that it doesn't lose its edge of like some of the hardcore cars that Do a poor job of being every day. They also have this edge of like when you drive them normally They want you to push them and drive them harder Like any McLaren has that feel like when you sit down in the lower NMS, it's just like come on drive faster and I'm glad that this car doesn't lose that edge. You still have a huge difference between what we're doing now with the stealth exhaust and the crazy super loud exotic feel of higher pms and and really moving the engine to its limits So I still have that edge. So there you have it There is clearly a good amount of tech in a car even if it's a gas car even into car like this That enables those Multipersonalities that enables it to go from a low-hard fast track car to something that you can actually manage to not be annoyed by every day It's pretty impressive It doesn't mean there isn't way more tech in some other cars that do way more computing things and self-driving things and stuff And I like to test all the time, but this was fun. This was a fun experience Let me know what other cars I should be testing maybe expanding my limits a little bit. This is really interesting Thanks for watching. Catch you at the next one. Peace
