 So what type of cars are you usually into is the question that I usually get now that we have this autofocus channel and we talk about all these different cars and the answer that I usually give is high-tech cars. That's the sort of generic version of it, right? A lot of electric cars are on the forefront of this so they come up a lot but just anything high-tech in a car is interesting. And I think that actually does still apply but also this one came up completely randomly and organically because I just kept seeing it on the road and I was like is that is that a Prius? I don't know if I've is this the new Prius and I eventually I had to ask and check it out and I guys I think the new Prius is kind of sick. I don't know if I'm crazy for this one but I really had to check it out and now that I've been driving it there are a lot of really cool features and tech in this car and I completely get it. I want to talk about this as a hybrid so a lot of people go straight to EVs as the highest tech cars because they typically are but let's be honest not everybody is ready for an electric car right away right they're expensive they are for the most part still relying on the infrastructure you need to be able to know you're gonna be able to charge wherever you go and so for a lot of people they're not ready for an EV yet but they are in the market for a car and the stop gap between them is a hybrid and this is sort of the king of hybrid world maybe not the king of hybrid world but it's the most familiar hybrid to most people this is the Prius prime meaning it's a plug-in hybrid it has 44 miles of electric only range you can plug it in and charge it up and never sip the gas at all but it does also have a gas tank for 400 plus miles of gas range it's got something crazy like 55 miles per gallon and it actually looks kind of good this time so let's check it out look at this thing man this this is the Toyota Prius prime the 2023 there are a lot of really good angles to it but I think in general what's happening here is they've given it very EV styling despite it not being fully electric so I'm gonna hit the the lock button here so you can see the lights the ambient lights have this sort of a check mark we've seen a lot of these in new cars the headlights are below them and I think it's got a pretty good front facing look the only weird part about the front honestly to me is this this big hub on the windshield wiper looks kind of weird but then it's got this big slope this big sloping windshield right from the front of the car all the way to the top and the back of the trunk which is a hatch it's got these big wheels it's got these 19 inch wheels you can see the brakes in there nothing too crazy and on this side is a gas cap this is actually the handle to get into the back seat we'll get to that in a second on the other side is gonna be your electric charge port door no crazy fast charging again it's a pretty small battery so just regular CCS you can plug it up just like that but here is another good angle the back of the Prius I think it looks good wait let's see the lights those you're left and right and you can also I'm gonna open the trunk actually this is a good opportunity to show you the hatchback so what's funny about this car is this is maybe the slowest opening hatchback I've ever seen but I also noticed it has the fastest opening and closing windows I've ever seen so I'll show you that in a second kind of random but you can fit charging equipment over here this is a tiny bit of extra storage in the Styrofoam but a reasonable size trunk I would say and obviously this is the the cover which you can pop out and actually fold in half and put on the floor if you don't want the cargo cover sort of privacy cover but I think it has a good look with this sort of a tail light bar here at the back this entire left to right width which turns on when the car is on and I'm liking it so that's the Prius Prime. Specs wise it's not even like a ton has changed about the Prius it was 130 horsepower before now it's 220 horsepower it's still slow it's still like a seven seconds error to 60 you're not getting this car for how sporty it is you're getting it for how efficient it is and for just how little you will pay to think about fuel but there's one more X factor because this Prius that I'm testing and I didn't even realize this until it showed up has one more trick up its sleeve which is solar on the roof well well dusty right now because we just had a storm but a solar panel on the roof that actually contributes to the car's drivable range so let me tell you about that I took this car for my daily commute which for me is about 29 miles and it was full at 100% I drove it all the way to the studio 29 miles and I had 40% when I arrived I didn't use any gas pure electric when I got here I left it out in the sun and I haven't driven it for the weekend because I had an ultimate for the road trip we went to Boston Montreal came back so it's like two and a half days later and it has 52% battery actually gained meaningful battery just by sitting out in the sun so this is maybe the only shipping production car I've ever seen with a solar panel good enough that if you actually drive it around with a short enough commute you might never actually have to plug in and pay for gas it's it's a small amount that you gain in range every day so let me show you you put the foot on the brake you hit power and this is the inside of the Prius it looks very familiar to some other Priuses I've never actually lived with the Prius before so this might be a very familiar to previous Prius owners but there's a screen up here behind steering wheel it's obviously very visible it's riding realign sight as you're driving normal driving stuff the software which I think is pretty solid and then a good amount of physical tactile buttons you've got temperature control you've got heated and cooled seats so whichever you choose up in the front there's a little bit of a cubby here which if you pop this back has a hashtag hidden compartment cool cup holders this little gear selector here which is interesting you kind of have to move it over and down to drive or over and up to reverse or just hit the button to park and there's a wireless charger in here for your phone so let me show you how that works because I thought it was kind of clever there is wireless Android Auto so you can do this and actually still have Android Auto you plug your phone in over and it sort of leans over to the side so there are these like guidance pieces of plastic here and it does say wireless charger and you pop that over and it leans your phone to the side and you can see it's charging and you can hit a button to turn that on or off so that's cool you still have all the typical controls here yes there are drive modes yes there is a sport mode I don't think most people will drive this in sport mode most of the time but in terms of typical interior stuff like a lot of plastic a lot of the typical 30 to $50,000 car price range stuff here these are a little bit nicer seats thing you might have seen in most pre-specs but this is again the highest and pre-us and you've got this LED strip across here which blinks to make sure you've got attention on the road because this can't be watching you while you're driving so the couple things I want to show you in this car one is the windows so just so we can confirm this is the fastest window I've ever seen in the car done just as the just the time it takes to open and close it's a pre-us guys there's not a lot for me to talk about in this car but I do want to know that that is pretty impressive the roof is obviously not a center because there's solar above me but let's look at the the UI for the solar so this is their software pardon the blinking that doesn't usually look like that it's just a solid red line in real life but this is the maps it's pretty reasonably usable it's Google Maps UI I think the data is really solid so I like using that but of course I still prefer wireless Android Auto over this it is more responsive and more functional but you have Bluetooth audio if you want to select your audio source here if you ever phone connected you can do that stuff but then there's all the other settings over here energy flow while you're driving will show you yes right now I am filling up the battery with solar and if I go to solar this is the really interesting part just by sitting in the sun today I've added 506 watt hours of battery doesn't sound like a whole lot it's half a kilowatt hour and I am literally generating 32 watts of power right now which I don't know might be enough to charge my phone but if you look at the totals for how much you're adding per day and actually sort to distance you can see this is a rainy day this is a storm that we had but just today by 3 30 pm I've added about two miles of range to the battery and so I've got over here my battery meter I'm at 50% battery as I told you before and so I've added 2.2 miles other days with fully like sunny days you've added over four miles of battery to the range so let's say you have a I don't know a five mile commute seven mile commute you theoretically with enough sunny days in a row just straight up won't pay for gas or electricity I feel like this is one of those things that I don't talk about too much in cars often because when I see a solar panel on a car it feels gimmicky it was on the Mercedes like world record car it was on I saw it on the app Terra I've seen it on a couple other cars that aren't shipping the the karma Rivera have one like I usually don't see solar panels on cars and when you have an electric car the battery is typically in the realm of a hundred kilowatt hours a hundred thousand watt hours so to add 500 watt hours in a day doesn't seem that significant it might only power you for a mile or two but this is a hybrid which means if you ever do run out of electricity you switch over to that gas and you can just go forever it's like a nice backup a nice intro to electric driving that's what's so cool about it so okay a couple of the last second things I noticed that are interesting about this car one it doesn't have the best visibility I've ever seen in a car it does slope quite a bit and you can tell that it's a sloping roof line but what's nice is it has a couple features one is there's a regular review mayor and you can see the visibility is decent but that can actually switch to a camera feed because there is a separate camera on the back of the car just for the review camera that is kind of nice to see and then second when you back the car up or put it in reverse there's this really nice view and it is this sort of a top-down view and when I drive it actually fills in the transparency of what's underneath the car so now I've fully filled in and I'm basically driving a transparent car around then it can show me what's underneath the car what's where I just was when I parked this big transparent car it's super easy so I appreciate that and then driving it around actually notice something got to hit the off button it depends on what car you're driving a lot of cars get different types of looks or different reactions around the Prius is interesting it's a new Prius so it did get some people looking at it because of that but sometimes when you drive a sports car around you get a lot of people pulling up at a stoplight revving they want a race or they want to hang or whatever on the freeway and that's a thing the Prius kind of has the opposite effect where because it's a Prius everyone tries to cut in front of you in line everyone thinks that you're the one that they're gonna get in front of on the entrance ramp to be the last one to join where they're supposed to kind of weird stuff that happens also there's a nice noise that it makes when I hit that lock button so it's not a horn like you'd usually have it's just a chime which is kind of cool I guess but that's the Prius honestly I am on I'm on board with the fact that hybrids right now in 2023 are a decent stopgap on the way to people getting more electric cars electric cars are expensive they're still range anxiety and they're still infrastructure questions and the Prius clearly makes a lot of sense and in this new package this new suit it's got on I get it I like the Prius man all right that's it thanks for watching kitchen the next one peace
