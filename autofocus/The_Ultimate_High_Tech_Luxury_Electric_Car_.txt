 So I'm just gonna be right up front honest from the beginning. I got a lot of good things to say about this car This is probably the most high-tech and impressive luxury electric car I've ever seen actually it is because I've tested some others that would be close the lucid air would be close Things like the my-bock things like the Bentley flying spur. I take this over all of them Okay, and that says a lot so let's just get right into it I'm gonna hopefully try to cover everything that is so impressive about this car I might miss some stuff, but let's just start with the basics So BMW i7 not the first BMW that I've tested on this channel And so it's not the first one with this crazy look at the front Kind of grows on you, but whatever we'll focus on that later The point though is the basics are it's a full-size luxury sedan Long sedan just like you've seen with these other luxury ones huge hood It's longer than a Cadillac escalade, but with that they move all the electronics up to the front Pretty good amount of trunk space huge back seat huge front seat and it's got dual motors Rocking around 530 horsepower it'll do a 0 to 16 about four and a half seconds, so it's not slow by any means And at a full charge. I'm seeing about 270 to 280 miles of range I looked on their website and it's showing things like 300 to 320, but I think in winter you'll probably expect to get a little less This is the way it's designed. I would personally never get this color But I get the people who are buying this car probably don't mind that you can see the taillights here Are these like little slots? Of course still the classic BMW logo with one of the cameras here on the back And if you want to open the trunk, I'll just go ahead and show you right off the bat Pretty good amount of trunk space not the biggest opening here I tried to put a box in here and it was a little bit tight But it's still worked and you have sub trunk space too for all your charging equipment if you want to put it down there So that's nice and that is your trunk So nothing too shocking there. It is automatically opening and closing and then You get around to the side. I mean, it's not a surprise that this car has a ton of room But what's inside really that's impressive is the tech and I kind of just want to get to that I mean we could talk about the outside. You want to talk about the wheels here? Big wheels 21 inch wheels front and back Pretty big brakes as well. Oh, it has these crystal headlights look at these DRLs are all Crystallly kind of like the flying spur again. Then these inset real headlights back here and Squinting pig is what I'll call it kind of looks like a Squinting pig now when I was talking about competitors earlier, you know full-size luxury sedans big Ford or sedans that are aiming to be Soft and cushiony and comfortable much more than they are supposed to be sporty So maybe a standard Model S a lucid air Or a my-bock. I think the lucid and the Tesla are much sportier and firmer Even at their softest settings than this is and the my-bock is kind of a match with this and the flying spur is somewhere in between I would take this over all of them and I mean that when I say it and And that's half because of how comfortable it is, but there's so much tech inside that it's kind of incredible So let's just get right into that so it actually starts with the door So this is the door handle here you can hit that button right there and it'll pop open a little bit But also it will completely open the entire door and it has sensors to know exactly how far it can open Based on if there's a car next to you or something like that. So let's try that again So closes by itself if I'm not next to the car Hit that button checks now there's not next nothing next to it. So it opens all the way That's pretty fire you get in the car if I want to close the door I put my foot on the brake And it closes for me That's already pretty solid if you want to open it automatically you hit that button right there It's capacitive, which is kind of annoying, but it does the same thing and I kind of Kind of just want to do that every time Now this is for sure 100% one of the cars that I would rather be in the back seat than the front seat But if we're gonna get it we might as well talk about being in the front seat and to be fair It's a very comfortable Solid experience. I was looking at these seats before they kind of they say leather because this top half is leather But then the bottom half is cloth and I was a little bit confused by the cloth decision because that's I mean It's comfortable, but it doesn't really feel quite as luxurious as the ones that are all full leather So I'll at least mention that But this this carpeting here is super soft like everything around me is comfortable the headliner is soft Alcantara everything is really well built and it almost goes to the extreme as far as like comfort and quietness We're like it doesn't do frameless windows. It does these big huge Framed windows to have incredibly good Noise isolation on the inside I can have a whisper. I tested this a whisper quiet conversation At 50 miles an hour. It's so quiet So you look around here at the basics the steering wheel pretty nice comfortable leather Couple buttons over here couple buttons over here cruise control stuff You've got these air conditioner vents and let's just look at these for a second They are capacitive so you can slide this little indicator on how much or how little air you want or just tap Which I don't love it still feels like I have to look to make sure I confirm exactly where I got it But at least it's pretty responsive and then there's this dial thing right here that lets you point the air Wherever you want. So that sort of system Works well. I just accidentally opened the door That's probably why you don't want capacitive buttons, but that's a sort of theme you see everywhere There is a lot of metal and there is a lot of leather But there also is a lot of glossy plastic especially here in the middle We've talked about this stuff in BMWs before this light this crystal thing the light comes in it shines It bounces like little rainbow reflections all over the car through the prism It is what it is this start stop button is kind of annoying if I'm on a nitpick I wish it wasn't so glossy because there's just a bunch of fingerprints that are gonna accumulate around here But wireless charger up here out of the way and out of distraction for the driver two cup holders Some storage and some USB-C ports in there and of course a door storage your handle and all the window controls and child lock and stuff over here And then seat controls lock and unlock Good to go here's your two screens up front with the mw's newest iDrive system This one is actually kind of interesting because if you want to switch up what you see Behind the steering wheel which is this is the uh the a our mode which which overlays directions on top of the road But that's only when you're using the built-in navigation system You also have android auto or apple car play wirelessly which I much prefer Um, but that's at least here. There's also a really good hud You can see where it would pop up right there and you can choose what displays on the hud and on this layout down here Whenever you want so it's pretty good. It's it's responsive. It's straightforward all this stuff Makes sense to me and so that's sort of just a moot point like there's other stuff happening with bmw software And there's all kinds of crazy text still this up here. It's got a sensor so that I can Do this and the volume changes. I told you guys this is not something I would want to do while driving but the fact that it works Is kind of neat so there's that you can change the sound of the cars acceleration to an iconic Hanzimmer sound and he actually composed the sounds for this car like there is just a crazy amount of customization and luxury and tech just in the front seat and briefly the driving experience like I said is super luxury focused so very soft very quiet Absorb's potholes it has three and a half degree rear wheel steering super super lightweight steering Something you're driving around and it feels like you're barely connected to the road at all You're just kind of floating over the top of it Which is I guess how you'd want to be Limousine around especially if you're in the back seat which we'll get to Um, but there's one other thing I kind of wanted to mention and I never thought I would say this out loud but The voice assistant in this car is actually pretty good. It's pretty decent. Okay. It does things like so you use the keyword Hey BMW Close the roof shade You Closing the roof roller blinds And it's pretty responsive pretty quick and pretty good at knowing what I actually wanted to do And it can do a surprising amount of things in the car it can change your drive mode It can turn up and down the volume it can activate the Messiah seats the heated seats change the temperature in the car All the basic stuff you'd want to do so if the capacitive stuff happening on the dash is a little too much Yeah, the voice assistant is pretty good There are microphones all throughout the car so that it knows which seat the voice is coming from So if I'm in the back seat and I say Hey assistant close or open my shade Without even saying what seat you're in it will close or open your shade because it knows what seat the voice is coming from It's it's kind of good most underwhelming piece of luxury in this car by far Is the speakers these are the bower's and Wilkins speakers so they're an optional upgrade I believe there are speakers like subwoofers in the seats There are also speakers in the headrests and there are speakers all around the cabin and they are very Average sounding mediocre sounding I much prefer. I mean the my box speakers were incredible But pretty much any other set of speakers has sounded just as good as if not better than these But that's enough talking about the front seat I want to show you the tech in the back seat of this car because it is on another level So let's hit that button right there And hit that button right here This one Same deal everything's automatic as you'd expect and let's hop into the biggest back seat you could possibly need And this is the automatic closed button right here Oh, so Where do I begin? I mean obviously maybe it's not obvious tons of legroom Pretty good amount of headroom lots of ambient lights everywhere Don't forget about the microphones But in general, it's really soft and comfortable this could be a three-seater in the back But I don't really think you want to put a second person in the back These are the executive back seats So these are the two sort of fully reclining jet-like seats and in the middle I'd probably just stick to having this armrest right here because you also get Hidden cup holder wireless charger And then a whole bunch of storage in there and two USB-C ports There is still a lot of cloth, you know, this is all soft cloth This part is leather There's a cloth and the seats are at like 60-70% cloth and then have some leather up here Super soft headrest right there Hidden USB-C ports in there for charging as well You've got your HVAC adjustment right here But you've probably noticed this already so let's just get into it. There's a screen here Each of the passengers has an entire screen Instead of having a tablet in the back And I kind of like this setup instead of like the tablets that we've seen that are detachable Because they allow you to control everything about your specific seats experience What would you control about your seat experience? Your climate control, your blinds right? So there's blinds in the back seat here If I hit that little button Pops up the blinds which is kind of like a shade Slash tent mechanism which is kind of fire You also have the roof shade, you can control all that stuff But of course there are modes for the back seat too And when I hit theater mode It puts all of these shades up and drops down A 30-inch 8K touch screen To watch movies and videos in the back seat So this has to boot up It does this whole dramatic booting sequence and Because all the shades are down now Everything is much more visible If the shade was up it would be more reflective Like you see the reflection over there But it does this boot up sequence and it is an Amazon fire stick UI So this car has its own SIM card, its own data connection So when you connect it to your cell phone plan It's like another device like an iPad or something like that And so it can automatically always be connected to the internet And you can always stream the way you could from a fire stick Because that's what the UI is Now if I can nitpick a little bit on the 8K touch screen in the back UI is really the only challenge with it And that's really most of this car Like there's so much tech but the UI is a little tricky Basically this is the fire stick UI in the middle And then you have a touch screen on either side Which right now it's just the time and the weather So I don't know you kind of put that over to the side Then when you want to change stuff about the display You do most of the controls over on the touch screen on the left Right? Okay, change aspect ratio to 32 by 9 Make it ultra wide or 16 by 9 Or change the volume by swiping up and down Change where it is in the car Maybe I'm the only one watching a movie Put it back in the middle for everyone All of that is from the side, right? But if I want to actually play with this part Then you this part It's a little bit janky Sometimes it responds well Sometimes it doesn't But you can fire up a movie Or you can sort of use this remote experience over here By jumping into the UI and knowing where to go Fire TV Continue And now this up and down arrow can switch Menu items and scroll between things Because this is the remote It's kind of annoying to have to jump through all this stuff And get through all the hoops It should sort of automatically know I want to do that And jump me there Either way Let's fire up I hear this is a pretty good movie So Top Gun Okay Maybe resume, top gun There we go And we're into the movie And the speakers would be boomin And the shades are down And we see everything In glorious high definition Also they say it's 8K I can't verify that it's 8K This is streaming from Amazon FireStake I don't even think that can stream in 8K I think that's just sort of a marketing number They can throw out at us But it looks pretty good I mean it looks pretty good for the screen in a back of a car So you know I don't hate this There's also an on-screen remote button like that So you can scroll up and down with this remote here You can move this over Go back home, hit back I mean It works It's not the most comfortable thing in the world Hopefully you don't have to do a whole lot of navigating through menus You just kick back and pull up YouTube And watch a video and you're fine It's not fast at all Either as you can tell But it works And you can pull up a forest auto reviews video And watch it in 4K on the screen Out of fact I don't think you can do that In the YouTube app it's telling me I have to use the built-in controls here And pull it up with the remote So as you can see the UI is not the friendliest part But it's just like This car has a screen in the back I don't know how else to explain that that's That's something I've never seen before And it's a giant screen And it's super useful Like I just want to reach over and hit the skip ad button That's under there But that doesn't work It has to use There a mode And then I have to skip With this to hit that So that's the only challenge That's literally the only challenge is UI Now I didn't even show you Lounge mode This is one more crazy thing you can do With this executive backseat Okay So there is modes Now I'm just going to go I wish this was another mode in here Because when you go to my modes There is no Lounge mode I think relaxed mode might do Something close to it Nothing really changed It's kind of unclear what these modes Are actually going to do Obviously theater mode does this But if you go to the seats In the executive backseat And you see that button right there Go ahead and hit that And wait for about 30 seconds For this seat This front seat here To move all the way up To basically touch the windshield This automatically happens on motors This is obviously also going to be difficult for Well maybe the driver doesn't really care But this seat moves all the way up This footrest motorizes out This Kind of pumps up As you'll see Start to move my feet in a second And it leans me all the way back And sort of creates this ultimate passenger princess experience Which I am totally cool with So what's that about 30 seconds We just got everything set up This entire thing is laid out I am destroying the rear visibility For the driver right now And also his side visibility Because now this seat is in the way of him seeing that mirror But I am so comfortable I don't even I don't even officer I'm chilling I'm chilling right now I just want to remind you This is half the price of the my-box This is undercutting elucid air This is undercutting Mercedes S-Class This is undercutting the Tesla Model S-plat This Ah no Not the plat The plat is about 105 This is about 120 to start But this This is a crazy back seat And it's It's kind of just a part of the way it's built in You can get driven around in this car all the time I would prefer To be driven in this car instead of driving it So I guess it's time for a conclusion So I have to get out of my super comfortable back seat To go over this But um I think the point here Is uh I like a lot of things about this car There are some quirks that you start to get to When you actually live with it Things like The fact that the front seat has to be Up a certain amount In order for the back seat user To actually use that display Look at This looks insane I also don't think it's the prettiest car in the world But hey To each of his own You know There's some pigs out there that would love this But honestly I'm thinking This all comes down to the fact that this is still One of the best types of vehicles to go electric This is what I was saying in the Bentley video Which is like Okay You want to make a large luxurious Ford or sedan Right What do people want when they buy those? They want it to be comfortable Obviously They want it to have a lot of space They want it to be quiet They want it to be smooth And they already know it's going to be heavy And it's going to be expensive Okay Well that Seems perfect to go electric Because now you end up with this Which is the quietest possible version Obviously It's the smoothest possible version to drive There's also a faster M70 version That does like a 3.5 seconds 0 to 60 In case you're into that But It's still expensive And it's still heavy And it's the best version of everything And it's also they put all the tech in this thing With the executive backseat I think they did a good job I don't know Let me know what you think Is there anything you don't like about the M70 version of this Other than This I'm super curious This might be the best luxuries to ban on the planet right now Thanks for watching Catch you guys the next one Peace
